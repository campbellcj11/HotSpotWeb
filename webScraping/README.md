# Web Scraping Setup
To Setup the python Facebook scraper you can either directly install the dependencies using:
<br />  
  <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
Then go ahead and run the scraper using:<br />
 <code>python3 facebookEventScraper.py</code>
This will output the amount of events it has uploaded to the database.<br />
<br />
  
You can also do this in a virtual enviorment by doing the following to avoid installing the dependencies locally. Be sure to have virtualenv installed on your computer before you follow these directions:<br />
  <code>virtualenv -p /path/to/python3 venv </code><br />
Then go ahead and activate your virtual enviorment:<br />
  <code>source venv/bin/activate</code>
Now install the dependencies:  <br />
  <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
<br />
Let us know if you have any questions.
